> My attempt at the JP Morgan Software Engineering Virtual Experience, I haven't done any form of Java in a long while but remember its original syntax so this was a challenge for me where the estimated time says 4-5 hours I can definitely say for certain this was under-exaggerated. I completed this task within 10 hours including studying and research time as well, to learn more about each Java element such as springboot, setting up H2 server, implementing a Kafka Listening Service for its message queue, and then developing a REST API controller.

I can say for certain the information given was too minimal for such tasks, and often left me confused having to trial and error debugging points, playing around with setup files as their claimed "application.yml" file was not setup at all and was blank so I had to research how to set this up to support H2 and connect to "midas-group" the folder structure we utilised for this project. Despite this, it was fun learning new skills that I could potentially see myself using in the future if I learn SpringBoot more in depth in combination to my current fullstack skills.
